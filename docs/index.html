        <p>
        This is a statistical model of the 2018 midterm elections for the U.S.
        House of Representatives. Using polling data, approval ratings,
        structural factors, and economic indicators, it estimates the number of
        seats each party will win, and their odds of winning control of the
        House. 
        </p>
        <p>
        More details about the model itself may be found 
        <a href="#model">below</a>.
        </p>


        <section class="content-block">
            <h2>How the odds have changed</h2>
            <p>
            The model is continuously updated with new polling data and
            approval ratings. As new information comes in, the odds may shift
            towards one party or another. Additionally, as we get closer to the
            election, there is less uncertainty in the result, since there is
            less time for a large shift in public opinion. This also changes
            the odds over time.
            </p>
            <p>
            The chart below plots the changin  odds of each party winning
            control. The estimates are plotted on a log-odds scale, instead of a
            traditional probability scale ranging from 0 to 100%. This is to 
            better reflect changes in probability—a shift from a 90% to 95%
            chance is much more consequential than a change from 50 to 55%.

            <h2>Distribution of outcomes</h2>
            <p>
            The model doesn't produce a single estimate of the number of seats
            each party will win. Rather, it estimates a probability for each
            possible arrangement of seats. The model's overall guess is the
            median of the distribution of seats—it is just as likely that the
            Democrats will win more seats as fewer seats.
            </p>
            <p>
            The table below summarizes the relative chances of each possible
            distribution of seats. The current distribution and the median
            outcome are highlighted. 218 seats are needed to control the House.
            </p>

            <h2>National Polling</h2>
            <p>
            The basis of the model is the generic congressional ballot, which 
            asks survey respondents which parties' candidate they plan on
            supporting in their local House race. The model estimates the true
            support for each party over time, and forecasts this estimate
            forwards to Election Day.  The chart below plots these estimates,
            along with an accompanying error bar indicating the uncertainty in
            the estimates. Notice how the uncertainty increases dramatically
            from today towards Election Day.

            <h2>Model</h2>
            <p>
            The model operates in two broad stages: first, it estimates
            national voter intent on a weekly basis and forecasts this estimate
            forwards to Election Day; second, it uses its voter intent estimate
            to predict the number of seats won by each party, using past
            elections as a guide.
